# Phase 16 Status

Phase 16 focused on struct lowering performance without changing vJASS/Zinc
semantics. The implementation keeps PJASS green, adds finer performance
instrumentation, and reduces several lookup/scan counters, but it does not yet
meet the aggressive Phase 16 timing targets.

## Implemented

- Split `emitStructSupport` accounting into generated helpers, source methods,
  lifecycle support, and method body lowering.
- Added generated support counters; struct allocate/create/destroy/deallocate
  helpers are still emitted directly and do not enter generic body lowering.
- Added `GeneratedKind` metadata for generated struct support functions.
- Added `LineFeatures` and skip counters for line-level lowering gates.
- Narrowed the struct-wide static/member pass to explicit struct receiver
  candidates instead of scanning every struct for ordinary member access.
- Treated `.` as member syntax only when followed by an identifier, so real
  literals such as `1.0` do not force struct receiver lowering.
- Added an early no-bracket path for array access rewriting.
- Avoided lambda extraction scans on function/method bodies that cannot contain
  anonymous function syntax.
- Merged syntax-lite metrics collection into the main syntax-lite scan.
- Added Phase 16 regression fixtures for generated support, source method
  lowering, `onDestroy`, and direct `deallocate`.

## War3Lib / Xlimon ALPHA

Validate command:

```bat
set WAR3_VJASSC_EXE=D:/Project/JassChanger/build/vjassc.exe
set WAR3_VJASSC_MODE=validate
lua lua/tasks/TaskCompileAlphaWithVjassc.lua D:/War3 D:/War3/Maps/Xlimon D:/WE/KKWE_Plugin
```

Result: pass. The task selected `Output/5_vjassc.j`, wrote
`Output/output.j`, and completed successfully.

Report summary from `Output/compiler_backend_report.json`:

| Metric | Phase 15 | Phase 16 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| vjassc internal total | 26601 | 23021 |
| vjassc internal codegen | 22641 | 19778 |
| jassCompilerMs | 27234 | 23611 |
| totalCompileMs | 37812 | 35066 |

The real ALPHA validate path improved but did not meet the Phase 16 target of
`totalCompileMs <= 32000`.

Compare command was also run with `WAR3_VJASSC_MODE=fast`, but the current
War3Lib `TaskCompileCompareAlpha.lua` still hardcodes `path.vjasscMode =
"full-validation"`. The report therefore recorded full-validation:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| jasshelper elapsedMs | 14263 |
| vjassc elapsedMs | 23013 |
| jassCompilerMs | 37765 |
| totalCompileMs | 51817 |

## Notes

- The useful changes are the receiver-candidate narrowing and lookup reduction:
  function and struct lookups are lower, and member access scans dropped by more
  than 60%.
- The ineffective part is that source method body lowering is still the dominant
  cost. Even after the scan reductions, `emitStructSupport.sourceMethods`
  remains around 12-13 seconds in the standalone run.
- The next optimization should avoid regex-based current-struct field/method
  rewriting inside source method bodies, likely by replacing that path with a
  token-level member rewriter and by caching per-method local/field plans.
